# An IOS themed calculator web app using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript

### What Inspired me to make this project?

I was given assignment to make a simple calculator as part of my coursework at uni, added some extra CSS to make it look similar to the iPhone UI.
Its hosted on netlify, so, if for some reason your calculator app crashes maybe check out the link!
